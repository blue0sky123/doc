can deploy a Hazelcast cluster in two ways: Embedded or Client/Server.

内嵌式好处是低延时的访问

By default, Hazelcast offers 271 partitions

after a cluster is formed, communication between cluster members is always via TCP/IP, regardless of the discovery mechanism used

....
<hazelcast>
    <import resource="your-configuration-XML-file"/>
    <import resource="file:///etc/hazelcast/development-group-config.xml"/> <!-- loaded from filesystem -->
    <import resource="classpath:development-network-config.xml"/>  <!-- loaded from classpath -->
    <import resource="${environment}-group-config.xml"/>
    <import resource="${environment}-network-config.xml"/>
</hazelcast>
....
